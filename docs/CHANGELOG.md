- Changed prefix from `revisions.` to `plugin.revisions`. Added it to docs.
- Added docs about how to protect the `revisions` folder from external access.
- Prefixed classes more to prevent future collisions with the core.
- Before, if a file or folder was not writable, the panel was hanged. Now, even if a revision could not be saved, renamed or deleted, it will not hang the panel.
