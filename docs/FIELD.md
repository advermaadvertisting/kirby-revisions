# Field

The revisions field will list the revisions of the current page.

It's really basic for the moment. Click a revision and you will se the textfile of it.

To reset a revision you need to copy / paste from the file into the panel, or copy the file from the revisions folder to the content folder.

[Installation](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-revisions/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

**It would be great if you want to develop an alternative field for it!**
