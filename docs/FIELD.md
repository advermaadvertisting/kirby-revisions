It's really basic for the moment. Click a revision and you will se the textfile of it.

To reset a revision you need to copy / paste from the file into the panel, or copy the file from the revisions folder to the content folder.

Read about how to [Install](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-revisions/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md) it.

**It would be great if you want to develop an alternative field for it!**
