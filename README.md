## Troubleshooting

If it does not work, make sure that there are permissions to create and change files and folders.

Also make sure that files and folders are not open in any application, as the application may lock them from editing.

## Use at own risk!

I don't take any responsibility of things that can go wrong with this plugin. It includes all things like lost revisions or content. If you are not sure, try it out on a test environment first.
